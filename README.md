## Environment

 Windows 10 (64bit)

 IntelliJ IDEA

 Jave version '15'
 
## Task

 A* algorithm

## How to use

 Put the all the source in the same document, after make the game run slower by changing the variable REDRAWING_PERIOD in S3App into 10 or 20, then you can play the S3 game.

## What I do
 In this project, we need to work in a RTS S3 Game and Implement the A* algorithm to reliaze a pathfinding function. In order to achieve this, firstly I need to design a proper  coordinate to represent each state(location). Then we need a check state function to distinct each location. Also, I use a hashmap to record each branch of node for the A* algorithm. In the A* part, I use a hashmap to recode F in each cell. Thus, this algorithm can be simply achieved by check the lowF cell each time.

1) Manhattan function: Designed for computing the Manhattan Distance.

2) checkState function: Designed for testing if the object have arrived the destination.

3) compareState function: Designed for testing if the object have already check this location, if have arrived once then ignore this location.
  
4) nextPossibleLocation function: This function is create to check if a cell in the map is free, I use the function "anyLevelCollision" of the S3 class here.
   
5) AStar function: Return the nearest way from the current location to destination.
